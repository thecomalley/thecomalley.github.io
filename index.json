[{"categories":["Git"],"contents":"Greetings! This post will guide you on how to configure Git to use different author email addresses based on where you clone the repository in your local directory. This can be particularly useful if you have different email addresses for personal projects, work, and different clients.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example of how you might organize your directories:\ncode/personal: For personal projects, you might want to use your personal email address. code/work: For your job, you might want to use your work email address. code/client1: For your first client, you might want to use a specific client email address. code/client2: For your second client, you might want to use a different client email address. To achieve this, you can use the includeIf directive in your global ~/.gitconfig file:\n[includeIf \u0026#34;gitdir:~/code/personal/\u0026#34;] path = .gitconfig-personal [includeIf \u0026#34;gitdir:~/code/work/\u0026#34;] path = .gitconfig-work [includeIf \u0026#34;gitdir:~/code/client1/\u0026#34;] path = .gitconfig-client1 [includeIf \u0026#34;gitdir:~/code/client2/\u0026#34;] path = .gitconfig-client2 In this configuration, you would have four separate .gitconfig files: .gitconfig-personal, .gitconfig-work, .gitconfig-client1, and .gitconfig-client2. Each of these files would contain the user email configuration for the respective directory.\nFor example, the .gitconfig-personal file might look like this:\n[user] email = personal-email@domain.com And the .gitconfig-work file might look like this:\n[user] email = work-email@domain.com And so on for client1 and client2. Remember to replace personal-email@domain.com, work-email@domain.com, etc., with the actual email addresses you want to use.\nTo validate that your configuration is working as expected, you can use the git config user.email command in the terminal while inside the repository directory. This command will display the email address that Git is currently configured to use for that repository. If the output matches the email address you specified in the .gitconfig file for that directory, then you\u0026rsquo;ve successfully configured Git to use different author email addresses based on the repository location.\nHappy coding!\n","date":"May 27, 2024","hero":"/posts/git-emails/hero.png","permalink":"https://thecomalley.github.io/posts/git-emails/","summary":"Greetings!

Now we have WinRM setup on the VM we can access it via ansible using the command from earlier inventory.yml' windows -m win_ping awesome! but pinging a VM isn\u0026rsquo;t much fun lets make a playbook!\nI\u0026rsquo;m still getting up to speed with how Ansible works for our / my fist playbook all we need to know is Ansible has\nplugins (kinda like terraform resources) collections (kinda like terraform providers) So we can grab the ansible.windows.win_feature plugin from the Ansible.Windows collection and add it to a playbook like below!\nplaybook.yml\n--- - name: My First Playbook hosts: windows tasks: - name: Install AD-Domain-Services with sub features and management tools ansible.windows.win_feature: name: AD-Domain-Services state: present include_sub_features: yes include_management_tools: yes now to run the whole thing we just run ansible-playbook -i 'inventory.yml' playbook.yml Awesome!\nNext Steps So there\u0026rsquo;s probably heaps of things i\u0026rsquo;ve missed or could do better\nHow to pass vars securely from Terraform to Ansible, (Ansible Vault?
